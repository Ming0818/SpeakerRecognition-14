# SpeakerRecognition

Program recognizes a speaker, basing on earlier processed recordings. 
In order to match a recording with properly speaker,
program uses Dynamic Time Warping algorithm and features computed from a spectrum- and time domain.

In main menu one is able to choose if recognition will be performed with already existing samples or with new freshly recorded.

If recording  has been chosen, program displays options.

Then we go to recording, the program shows which sample will be recorded after clicking the start

When all base samples are recorded, the time is coming for recording sample to recognize.

Subsequently program binds this sample with most similar sample from these recorded earlier.

There is also a possibility to compare sample to recognize with another, less similar sample.

If loading samples has been chosen at the beggining:
